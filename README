This repo contains a *never-finished* NZB client for AmigaOS

It was a multi-threaded application using the MUI graphical
interface, but i've stopped working on it since i've found
NZBGet and realized it was less work to just port that...

The neither finished aminet-like readme file was as follows:


Short:        AmiNZB - NZB Download Manager
Author:       Diego Casorran
Type:         comm/tcp
Version:      0.1
Architecture: m68k-amigaos > 3.0


   Introduction
 ============================================================================

	What is/are those NZB files, you ask?  Are a pre-formatted XML files
which basically contains Usenet's Message-IDs... Those NZB files are 
automatically generated by some WWW engines which its main job is to locate 
multi-part messages (segments) from the usenet groups alt.binaries.#?

	AmiNZB downloads all those segments, decodes them, and joining each
decoded segment is how the final file is created. Also, needs to mention
AmiNZB is a multi-threaded application, the main task is reserved to the 
MUI Interface, theres another separated task to the File Selection Manager,
which creates its own mui application as well to let you select which files
from a NZB file to download (has its own NList with multi-select ability),
and every time you click on "download selected" from that window, a new task
is created which the Usenet Manager, this task handles the downloading of 
all segments, decoding and saving them to disk.


   CONFIGURING IT TO WORK WITH IBrowse:
 ============================================================================

Go to the MIME settings, and add a new entry with the following data:

MIME Type:	application/x-nzb
Extension:	nzb
Action:		External viewer
Viewer:		<path-to>AmiNZB
Arguments:	%f

...and thats all, AmiNZB will be loaded when you click on a NZB file (if it 
isn't already) and its Manager window will pop-up, where you can select which
files to download.
